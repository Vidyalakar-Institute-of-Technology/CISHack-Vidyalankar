      <p><mark>Computer-based training, Web-based training, Internet based training, online training, e-learning (electronic learning), m-learning (mobile learning), computer-aided distance education - online education goes by many names and comes in a variety of styles, but at its core: “Online education is electronically supported learning that relies on the Internet for teacher/student interaction and the distribution of class materials.”</p></mark>
      <p><mark>
      From this simple deﬁnition comes an almost inﬁnite number of ways to teach and learn outside of traditional classrooms and away from college campuses. With online education, students can turn anywhere with Internet access and electricity into a classroom. It can include audio, video, text, animations, virtual training environments and live chats with professors. It’s a rich learning environment with much more ﬂexibility than a traditional classroom.</p></mark>

      <p><mark>
      Happiness is just everyone’s deal only the outlook of an individual differs. Here I am providing some of the points that can be helpful in improvising a person’s enthusiasm and also leads him for a cheerful life:</p></mark>
      <p><mark>
      Be Positive: There is both a positive or negative aspect of every situation. The first and foremost key for happiness is to be positive and always see the positive aspect of any scenario. There is a saying that failures are the lessons for success, its simple even your failures are build-up you as a person. So, positivity is a therapy for being cheerful and motivated.</p></mark>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal"><mark>Always be Motivated!</h1></mark>
      <p><mark>
      Motivation is an essential factor that changes positive thought into instant action. It switches a great idea into action and can undoubtedly affect the world around you. However, not all are born with motivation. People sometimes have disbelief in themselves; they often say, “I can’t do that” or “the timing is not right.” Being demotivated means living a life as a worn-out machine. Your life will become dull without any spark. So, to gain inner peace and satisfaction in life, you must always stay motivated.</p></mark>
      <p><mark>
      Motivation is a force to push you closer toward your dream. If Steve Jobs lacked the motivation to launch Apple, you would not get an iPhone or iPad. It gives you a purpose to live you with a forever smile on the face. Thus, realizing and working on your self-motivation skills will make you capable of taking control of different aspects of life.</p></mark>
      <p><mark>
      The critical elements of self-motivation are resilience and optimism. The former will help you bounce back during difficult times, whereas later, you will show you a brighter side ahead. This way, you will be able to control your emotions that are holding you back.</p></mark>
